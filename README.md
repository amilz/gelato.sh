# Gelato.sh 

This is the repo for the homepage for gelato.sh. The project is the 
distillation of many script that have lived on localhost for too long.
Now working to operationalize them, so that they are live, and available
to the public.

## On-Exchange Balance

The primary goal of this website is to provide an tool to look into
exchange wallet balances to see how their SOL and SPL token holdings
evolve over time. The primary objective is to provide insights related 
to large movements with exchanges. Since an exchange obscures activity
from the public, it is worthwhile to watch the entry/exit, as this can
inform users of potential volatility (large inflows), whale accumulation 
or even solvency issues (large outflows). We don't care how you read or
interpret the data--only wish to ensure that it is available to you.

## Additional Features
In the coming weeks we'll work to quickly add tools or research related to the following:
- Wallet clustering/identification via exchange deposit address reuse (DAR)
- Whale/insider wallet watching
- Scripting and automation for wallet watching

## Thank you
Thank you for your interest, and please check back with us soon!
